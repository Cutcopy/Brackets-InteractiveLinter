Brackets-Interactive-Linter
===========================

Brackets integration with JSHint.  Interactive Linter will provide feedback as JavaScript files are modified with JSHint details easily accessible from the line gutter of the editor.  Interactive Linter also keeps its settings per project (.interactiveLinter), which you can manually modify to customize JSHint settings for the entire project.  Of course, JSHint annotation in your files will continue to work.<br><br>
This was inspired by brackets-continuous-compilation extension (https://github.com/JoachimK/brackets-continuous-compilation), so thank you for that
